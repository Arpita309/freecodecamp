### 3 . Markdown Previewer :
   This project was about how to use React component and it helped me in familiarising with state of a component. render() gets called every time the state of component get modified. 
   In this project, user enters a mark down text in the input area, it gets converted to Marked preview.

### 4 . Pomodoro Clock :
   This clock is based on the Pomodoro Technique - he technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
   In this you can set the session's and break length as per your wish , a sound will be produced after a session or break is completed.
